			<br> Title: SL(3, Z) modularity and 4d partition functions
			<br> Abstract: One of the most exciting progress in understanding AdS/CFT in the past few years is the success of reproducing AdS5 black hole entropy from the computation of N=4 SYM. This generalizes the early understandings about BTZ black hole entropy, which can be counted from the SL(2,Z) modularity of 2d CFT partition functions. In this talk, I will explain how to apply the SL(3,Z)  modularity of partition  functions of N=4 SYM to understand the entropy of dual AdS5 black hole. Besides, it is known that 2d CFT partition functions reveal a phase diagram for SL(2,Z) family of black holes in the dual gravity, which are parametrized by a rational number the moduli will take value in. This is known as the Farey tail story. I will also explain the evidence about SL(3,Z) family of saddles existing, which are parametrized by a pair of independent rational numbers. This gives a generalized SL(3,Z) modularity which is less known in the literature.

			<br> Title: Special flow equation and GKP-Witten relation
			<br> Abstract: I will speak about my recent work on a new framework for the reconstruction of bulk theory dual to conformal field theory (CFT) by means of flow equation. A flow equation generally describes a non-local course-graining of elementary fields consisting of given quantum field theory so as to remove the contact divergence. This property of the flow equation enables one to construct a class of composite operators which behave as geometric objects including metric in the holographic space after taking the quantum average. In this talk I will explain a certain extension from the free flow equation, which we call a special flow equation. Using the special flow equation, the conformal transformation for a normalized smeared operator exactly becomes the isometry of anti-de Sitter space (AdS). By employing this special flow equation with O(N) vector models, we explicitly show that the AdS geometry as well as the scalar field satisfying the GKP-Witten relation concurrently emerge in this framework.

			<br> Title: Fermionic BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional N=2 superconformal gauge theories
			<br> Abstract: We construct fermionic BPS Wilson loops in N=2 superconformal SU(N)×SU(N) quiver theory and N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. The connections of these fermionic BPS Wilson have a supermatrix structure. We construct timelike BPS Wilson lines in Minkowski spacetime and circle BPS Wilson loops in Euclidean space. These Wilson loops involve dimensionful parameters. For generic values of parameters, they preserve one real (complex) supercharge in Lorentzian (Euclidean) signature. Supersymmetry enhancement for Wilson loops happens when the parameters satisfy certain constraints.
