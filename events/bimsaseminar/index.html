			<br> Title: SL(3,Z) modularity and 4d partition functions
			<br> Abstract: One of the most exciting progress in understanding AdS/CFT in the past few years is the success of reproducing AdS5 black hole entropy from the computation of N=4 SYM. This generalizes the early understandings about BTZ black hole entropy, which can be counted from the SL(2,Z) modularity of 2d CFT partition functions. In this talk, I will explain how to apply the SL(3,Z)  modularity of partition  functions of N=4 SYM to understand the entropy of dual AdS5 black hole. Besides, it is known that 2d CFT partition functions reveal a phase diagram for SL(2,Z) family of black holes in the dual gravity, which are parametrized by a rational number the moduli will take value in. This is known as the Farey tail story. I will also explain the evidence about SL(3,Z) family of saddles existing, which are parametrized by a pair of independent rational numbers. This gives a generalized SL(3,Z) modularity which is less known in the literature.

			<br> Title: Fermionic BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional N=2 superconformal gauge theories
			<br> Abstract: We construct fermionic BPS Wilson loops in N=2 superconformal SU(N)Ã—SU(N) quiver theory and N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. The connections of these fermionic BPS Wilson have a supermatrix structure. We construct timelike BPS Wilson lines in Minkowski spacetime and circle BPS Wilson loops in Euclidean space. These Wilson loops involve dimensionful parameters. For generic values of parameters, they preserve one real (complex) supercharge in Lorentzian (Euclidean) signature. Supersymmetry enhancement for Wilson loops happens when the parameters satisfy certain constraints.
