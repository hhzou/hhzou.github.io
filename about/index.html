	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> 	
		I am currently a PhD candidate in physics at Virginia Tech in the United States and I will defend for my PhD degree in the Spring of 2021. Rightnow I am on the job market for a postdoc position on theoretical high energy physics. My main research interests are supersymmetric quantum field theories, mirror symmetry, string theory as well as related mathematical topics.

	<p>
		Before my PhD study at Virginia Tech, I earned a master degree in theoretical physics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in China.
